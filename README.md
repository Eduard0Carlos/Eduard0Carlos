# 👋 Hi there

I am a Full Stack Software Engineer with 5+ years of experience building scalable, high-performance, production-ready systems in demanding enterprise environments.

I primarily work within the .NET ecosystem, where I have helped design and implement reusable enterprise architectures, distributed via NuGet, supported by automated CI/CD pipelines (Azure Pipelines) and dedicated technical documentation — reducing rework, accelerating onboarding, and standardizing delivery across teams.

On the frontend side, I have worked on UI microservices using React, Vite, and Webpack. 

I thrive in environments where technical decisions matter, quality is non-negotiable, and collaboration is practiced—not just talked about.

# 🚀 Expertise

- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Microservices and distributed systems
- Application migrations (.NET 5 → .NET 8) with a strong focus on performance and stability
- Banking systems and invoice/billing workflows, with high attention to reliability, performance, and critical business rules
